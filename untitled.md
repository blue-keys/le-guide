Root certificates are public key certificates that help your [browser](https://windowsreport.com/best-browser-multiple-tabs/) determine whether communication with a website is genuine and is based upon whether the issuing authority is trusted and if the digital certificate remains valid.

If a digital certificate is not from a trusted authority, you’ll get an error message along the lines of “_There is a problem with this website’s security certificate_” and the browser might block communication with the website.

Windows 10 has built-in certificates and automatically updates them. However, you can still manually add more root certificates to Windows 10 from certificate authorities (CAs).

There are numerous certificate issuing authorities, with Comodo and Symantec among the best known.

## How can I add Windows 10 root certificates manually?

### Method 1: Install certificates from trusted CAs <a href="#1" id="1"></a>

This is how you can add digital certificates to Windows 10 from trusted CAs.

1. First, you’ll need to download a root certificate from a CA. For example, you could download one from the [GeoTrust site](https://www.geotrust.com/resources/root-certificates/).
2. Next, open Local Security Policy in Windows by pressing the Win key + R [hotkey](https://windowsreport.com/windows-10-keyboard-shortcuts/) and entering ‘secpol.msc’ in Run’s text box. Note that Windows 10 Home edition doesn’t include the Local Security Policy editor. If your Windows key doesn’t work, check this [quick guide](https://windowsreport.com/windows-key-not-working-windows-10/) to fix it.
3. Then, click **Public Key Policies** and **Certificate Path Validation Settings** to open a Certificate Path Validation Settings Properties window.
4. Click the Stores tab and select the **Define these policy settings** check box.
5. Select the **Allow user trusted root CAs to be used to validate certificates** and **Allow users to trust peer trust certificates** options if they’re not already selected.
6. You should also select the **Third-Party Root CAs and Enterprise Root CAs** checkbox and press the **Apply** > **OK** buttons to confirm the selected settings.
7. Next, press the Win key + R hotkey and enter ‘certmgr.msc’ in Run’s text box to open the window shown in the snapshot directly below. That’s the Certification Manager which lists your digital certificates.[![certificates manager](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-MCFj\_VEhiEqSWXrtGBs%2Fuploads%2FygQgLu3jaNCIywATi7Xy%2Ffile.svg?alt=media)](https://cdn.windowsreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/digital-certificate.jpg)
8. Click **Trusted Root Certification Authorities** and right-click **Certificates** to open a context menu.
9. Select **All Tasks** > **Import** on the context menu to open the window shown below.[![certificate import wizard](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-MCFj\_VEhiEqSWXrtGBs%2Fuploads%2FxyNhFWTIPgoTupuA6wwy%2Ffile.svg?alt=media)](https://cdn.windowsreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/digital-certificate2.jpg)
10. Press the **Next** button, click **Browse,** and then select the digital certificate root file saved to your HDD.
11. Press **Next** again to select the **Automatically select the certificate store based on the type of certificate** option.
12. Then you can press **Next** > **Finish** to wrap up the import wizard. A window will open confirming that “_the import was successful._”

2. Click **File** and then select **Add/Remove Snap-ins** to open the window in the snapshot below.[![console root mmc](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-MCFj\_VEhiEqSWXrtGBs%2Fuploads%2F1yIDCAPJzitNEhshubal%2Ffile.svg?alt=media)](https://cdn.windowsreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/digital-certificate4.jpg)
3. Next, you should select **Certificates** and press the **Add button**.
4. A Certificates Snap-in window opens from which you can select **Computer account** > **Local Account**, and press the **Finish** button to close the window.
5. Then press the **OK** button in the Add or Remove Snap-in window.
6. Now you can select **Certificates** and right-click **Trusted Root Certification Authorities** on the MMC console window as below.[![import root certificate](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-MCFj\_VEhiEqSWXrtGBs%2Fuploads%2FRsWdiGyJupaVplyVuhiy%2Ffile.svg?alt=media)](https://cdn.windowsreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/digital-certificate5.jpg)
7. Then you can click **All Tasks** > **Import** to open the Certificate Import Wizard window from which you can add the digital certificate to Windows.
